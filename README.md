Here you'll find the code and data used to produce the results of Mahmoud, Done &amp; De Marco 2018 (MNRAS).

Commenting is in progress (or certainly on the list). But don't hesitate to send questions to mahmoud.raad@yahoo.co.uk

Contained in the main .py file are:

  -- Physical constants as global variables.
  
  -- Global variables derived from the prior spectral fitting.
  
  -- A collection of useful time series processing routines, all required for our results (apart from the function                  "Coherence"), but also easily applied to your own light curves.
  
  -- Subroutines for the calculation of the components of fourier power spectra and lag spectra.
  
  -- The function "output" which calls those subroutines and produces the modelled power spectra, lag-frequency spectra and          lag-energy spectra.


To reproduce the plots found in MDDM18, just download and run spectral_timing_model_MDDM18.py!
